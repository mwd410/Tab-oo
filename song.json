/**
 * Subdivision values are calculated by determining the number
 * of that subdivision in a 4/4 measure.
 * 4 = quarter notes--4 quarter notes in a 4/4 measure.
 * 12 = triplet 8th notes - 12 triplet 8th notes in a 4/4 measure.
 * 20 = quintuplet 16th notes - 20 quintuplet 16th notes in a 4/4 measure--4 per beat.
 * 3 = triplet half notes.
 * 7 = group of 7. This can be displayed as 8th notes or quarter notes. sometimes, 
 *      you'll see 7:4 which means there's 7 in the span of 4, in which case, 
 *      they'd be quarter notes. if 8th notes, it'd have 7:8 written above.
